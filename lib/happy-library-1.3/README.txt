Happy-Commons
===========================

Welcome to the Happy-Library.
This library contains collections, parallel-loops, parallel-sorting-algorithm, generators, many design patterns, and more ...

Building from source
--------------------
The simple way is to use eclipse and execute the build.xml ant-script.
If you don't use eclipse you can just download the org.happy.commons.jar 
or try to build it on your own by using build-org.happy.library.xml.

Have Fun!
